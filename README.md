- 👋 Hi, I’m @BitnBite  Im new here but I have been around since tranistors were really expensive and you were lucky if they lasted longer than a few miliseconds when powered up. I have watched electronics change and grow at remarkable speeds since learning the 5 tube AM radio.
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything. i know a little bit about a lot things. I am looking to use some of my skills to help get some of my ideas into practise. I have been building comtrols and automation for years and enjoying my ideas to life. 
- 🌱 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some of the controls I am working on. I have the ideas and the hardware part all worked out and am looking for some help in making the project come togerher with the sofrware. I am looking at the esp32 line of microcontrollers and like that the sensors and wifi will do all and more that I am interested in. If you have some skills and would like to see what we could do please hit me up.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Well I can be reached by email, I do try to check it almost daily.  patkebs@gmail.com
